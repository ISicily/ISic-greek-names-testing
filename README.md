This repo contains a subset of I.Sicily files imported from the I.Sicily [https://github.com/ISicily/ISicily] repository on 30.01.2026, for the purposes of testing name and person indexing and LGPN alignment.
A copy of the I.Sicily authority lists has been included to facilitate file validation and data look-up.
The dataset consists of 1095 files, all in Ancient Greek, which have  been manually name tagged, using `<persName>` and `<name>` tags. The full principles of name/person annotation are outlined in the I.Sicily wiki at [https://github.com/ISicily/ISicily/wiki/Encoding:-text#named-entities] although these guidelines have not yet been fully or exactly implemented. In these files humans are tagged as `<persName type="attested">` while gods and mythical beings are tagged as `<persName type="divine">`. `<name>` has types intended to distinguish single personal names, untyped, from patronyms (matronyms, etc.), Latin praenomen, nomen and cognomen, etc. Ethnics are tagged using `<placeName type="ethnic">`.
